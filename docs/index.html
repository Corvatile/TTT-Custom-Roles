        <h1>Custom Roles for TTT Docs</h1>
        <p><b>Welcome to the Custom Role for TTT Docs website!</b> This website is the best place to find information about playing, configuring, and developing with Custom Roles for TTT.</p>
        <p>Custom Roles for TTT is an addon for Garry's Mod that adds over 40 new roles to the Trouble in Terrorist Town gamemode, along with a handful of other tweaks and improvements. You can download the addon through the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2421039084">Custom Roles for TTT Steam Workshop</a> page.</p>
        <p>If you would like to stay up to date with the development of Custom Roles for TTT, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/BAPZrykC3F">Discord server</a>. There you can find announcements for new updates; forums for suggestions, discussion, and support; user-made roles; and you can even join the Custom Roles for TTT beta to get early access to new features. Outside of Discord, you can also keep an eye on our <a href="https://github.com/Custom-Roles-for-TTT/TTT-Custom-Roles/tree/release">GitHub repository</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/Custom-Roles-for-TTT/projects/1/views/1">project board</a> to see planned features and dev builds before they are announced.</p>
